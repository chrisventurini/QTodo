# Todo Desktop Application With C++ and QT

## 100 Days of Coding

With my resent new employment with [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com/) I've decided to reboot my #100DaysOfCoding challange by learning C++ by developing a desktop todo app. 

This project is going to leverage C++, Visual Studio, the QT Open Source Tookit, and Google Test.
